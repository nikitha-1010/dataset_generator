# dataset_generator
This script generates a new synthetic dataset that closely resembles original dataset using statistical sampling techniques. The generated data maintains similar distributional properties for both numerical and categorical features.

The code assumes that the continuous variables (Value1 and Value2) in the original dataset follow a normal distribution.

A new dataset is generated by using the distribution of the categorical variable and the mean and standard deviation of the numerical variables from the original dataset.
To evaluate the similarity between the original and generated datasets, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test is applied to the numerical variables.
A smaller KS statistic indicates a closer match between the original and generated distributions.

For visual comparision, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots for comparing the distributions of continuous variables and Count plots for comparing categorical variable.
